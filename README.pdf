# Galaxy Classification Project

This project classifies galaxy images into four types: Elliptical, Spiral, Barred Spiral, and Other/Unclassified.
The classifications are based on the Hubble Sequence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_sequence

## Overview

### Raw Data

Start from:

1. One folder containing ~16k images of galaxies in 424x424 resolution, each with it's own asset_id
2. A csv file that links asset_id to obj_id which is the standard way to catalogue galaxies
Link : https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr7/en/tools/quicklook/quickobj.asp?id=587738947200024706
3. A csv file containing obj_id and a lot of features including the classification of that galaxy

The process:

1. Link the asset_id to the classification
2. The dataset uses a lot of classifications (very specific ones) so for the purposes of this project we group them in the 4 big ones mentioned
3. Crop images to keep only the main galaxy (otherwise the photos are very noisy and clutered with other galaxies)
4. Equalize the dataset by applying effects (rotations, shears, mirroring...) to better train the model
5. Extracts numerical features from each cropped image.
6. Selects the most important features.
7. Trains a Random Forest classifier on those features.

## Data Preparation

* Original images: `dataset/raw/images/`
* CSV mapping: `dataset/processed/augmented.csv` with columns `image_path,galaxy_class`

### Augmentation

I wrote a script to balance classes by flipping, rotating, and adjusting brightness.

### Cropping

I use OpenCV to:

1. Blur and threshold the image.
2. Find contours and pick the one nearest the center.
3. Crop around that contour and save to `dataset/processed/cropped/`.

## Feature Extraction

I extract:

* 8 classical features (concentration, ellipticity, gini, M20, asymmetry, smoothness, mean intensity, edge density)
* 10 HOG features
* 6 RGB color histogram bins
* 50 CNN embedding features (ResNet50)

Results are saved to `dataset/processed/all_features_cropped.csv`.

## Feature Selection and Training

1. Load features and split into train/test (80/20, stratified).
2. Train a Random Forest to get feature importances.
3. Pick the top 15 features and retrain a second Random Forest.
4. Evaluate on the test set and print metrics.

## Results

* Final accuracy: ~60%
* Classes still confused: Spirals vs Barred Spirals.

## Problems and Fixes

* Too many types of galaxy some of them having only 1 (one) example : Grouping galaxies based on their prefix
* Predictions preferred Elliptical Galaxies due to the big number of data on them : Added image effects to equalize the number of photos.
* Very low original accuracy : Better feature selection using a CNN and more features in general (went from 8 to 15)
* Slow processing: added `tqdm` progress bars to make sure we don't find out the program is stuck after 1 hour (happened).
* Noisy images: cropped central galaxy before feature extraction.

## Next Steps

* Improve image preprocessing (deblurring).
* Try more features (LBP, Fourier features).
* Test other models (XGBoost, MLP).

## Other Details 

* Time to extract the features ~ 1:30 (i have no gpu and bad cpu on the machine i worked on)
* The modest results are part due to my inexperience but also because of the low resolution data we are working with
